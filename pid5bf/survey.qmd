# Welcome to our survey!

You will be provided with a list of things different people might say about themselves. We are interested in how you would describe yourself. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers. Weâ€™d like you to take your time and read each statement carefully, selecting the response that best describes you.

```{r}
sd_next()
```

```{r}
# Loop up total number of items
ni <- nrow(vitems)

# Set desired number of items per page
ipp <- 10

# Initialize tag list
out <- shiny::tagList()

# Loop through pages
for (p in 1:(ceiling(ni / ipp))) {
  # Find items on current page
  pitems <- (ipp * (p - 1) + 1):min(p*ipp, ni)
  
  # Add page start div opener to tag list
  out <- shiny::tagList(out, htmltools::HTML(
    paste0('<div id="page', p, '" class="sd-page">')
  ))

  # For each item on current page
